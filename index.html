<h1> Making A Convincing Argument</h1>   
<p>
    My cause that drives me is baseball. It has developed me into the person that I am today. It has staught me many life lessons, most importantly how to deal with and overcome adversity. Baseball is built around failure. In baseball, you fail over and over before you find success. This concept can be related to other aspects of life in the way that success does not come easily, and you must face failure before you succeed. A possible misconception about my cause is that I should focus on other things in life that are seen as more important than sports, such as academics and relationships with other people. According to Cairo Chapter 3, "after we've gorwn enamored of our beautiful models, it's difficult to get rid of them. We all have a very sensitive mental trigger that reacts when we're challenged by contradictive information." This can be seen in arguments against my own viewpoints. One way that I can help someone through this misconception is by explaining how sports, such as baseball, have helped me in my academics by causing me not to become distressed about occasional failures in school, and how it has helped me in building relationships with other people by being a part of a team and learning how to rely on other people in my journey towards success, whether that be in the classroom or in the outside world. The backfire effect can possibly hurt my argument because people commonly view extracurriculars as distractions from academics and very time consuming as to where you possibly don't make strong relationships with other people. All in all, many people disagree with my motivations and cause, but I believe that baseball helps me in multiple facets of life and has helped develop me as a person throughout my life.
